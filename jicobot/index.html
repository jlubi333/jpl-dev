Jico Language Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Format:
[program]        :: start::[state]\n[line]+
[line]           :: [rule | comment]\n
[rule]           :: [state]:[blocked string]->[direction]&amp;[state]
[state]          :: {String}
[blocked string] :: [indicator][indicator][indicator][indicator]
[indicator]      :: 0 | 1 | *
[direction]      :: N | E | S | W | X
[comment]        :: # {String}

Explanation:
A program is made up of a start state and a series of lines, which can be a rule or a comment.
The start state is the entry state for the program.
Every line ends with a newline character ('\n').
A rule is a single instruction in a Jico program.
The state serves an identifier for a rule.
A blocked string is a string that contains information about which surrounding tiles are blocked.
A blocked string is ordered as follows: North, East, South, West
An indicator can be:
    0: empty tile
    1: blocked tile
    *: wildcard (any tile)
A direction can be any of the following: north (N), east (E), south (S), west (W), or stationary (X).
A comment is a line prefixed with a pound sign (#) and is ignored by the interpreter.

The program interpreter will analyze all rules in a Jico program and find those that match.
If more than one rule matches the current scenario, an OverhandledStateError will be thrown.
The program will then execute the rule and update the board until the board is completed or
the program is terminated by a user. If a move is impossible to make (i.e. a wall blocks the
user), an ImpossibleMoveError will be thrown.

Notes:
- Arbitrary whitespace is permitted

Examples:
# State 0: if there is nothing to the north, go north and back into State 0.
0 : 0*** -> N &amp; 0

# State 0: if there is something to the north, go west and into State 1.
0 : 1*** -> W &amp; 1

# State 1: if there is nothing to the south, go south and back into State 1.
1 : ***0 -> S &amp; 1

# State 1: if there is something to the south, remain stationary and go into State 0.
1 : ***1 -> X &amp; 0
